\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths

                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
